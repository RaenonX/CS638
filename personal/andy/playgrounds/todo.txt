# TODO:
 1. try remove one stop and put passenger flows to closest
     two bus stops that have the same route
 2. see if the amount of passenger at one stop is too large
 3. calculate time if remove one stop is quicker
     - how to determine which stop to remove?
     - factors influencing time travel or

 1. find overlap routes > some threshold (maybe do directions?)
    - need asked
       1.
           - route 2 overlaps with route 8 has roughly 24%
           - route 8 overlaps with route 2 has > 40%
       2. choose a better overlap color plotting scheme (TODO)

    - add in directions to calculation (TODO)
       - use df color_route
 2. from their common bus stops, find more closely located bus stops
    and determine if they can be integrated by calculating their sum
    of passenger flow
 3. see if removing a bus stop works and improve the
    time traveling of that combined bus route
       - removing a bus stop when adjacent bus stop
         is close to each other

# TODO:
think of a function that calculating the score of removing, consolidating, or leaving the bus stop the same.
