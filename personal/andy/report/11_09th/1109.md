[For Convenience, here is a map (from the 1019.md report) of all 47 routes that are currently in service]

We could now generate random riders and find the nearest bus stop for each rider. The black dots are riders and the red crosses are bus stops. 

User can input `number_of_riders` to generate the above plots (500 samples â‰¤ 2 seconds). We are about to add more features such as `service_type` (e.g. weekday, weekend, holiday) and `time_of_the_day` (e.g. 6:00, 12:00, 18:00), since bus frequency of Madison Metro Transit and some certain routes run differently on different days of a week and different times of a day. Another feature we'll add is to put more important landmarks such as airport, grocery stores, bars, and libraries as one of the factors to determine areas that are more convenient, riding-a-bus-wisely, and areas that are less convenient (e.g. having to walk longer to a bus stop and have fewer landmarks nearby) by marking it a `convenience_score`.

We're also considering using a module called `FuncAnimate` to generate animated plots and turn it into the simulator. Our goal is to generate animated plots and automate the process of producing plots for analyses using input data from users, and do more in-depth analyses using our simulator; for example, how far a person can reach, given `service_type` and `time_of_the_day`, within 30 minutes.

For points that are not really close to bus stops, we'll use the distance to calculate the time traveling from the point to bus stops using the `dist` (in miles) column. And from `stop_id`, we can then access routes that go through that stop to retrieve data such as the corresponding trips schedule, given `time_of_the_day`, to calculate how long a person would have to wait by the time one arrives the nearest bus stop.
