Great work!!!  I'll rate these a 4.

I don't know how much the legend really help for the first map.  There are too many colors for me to match up.  Figure out what you want to talk about, and use the colors to bring attention to that.  For example, you could have specific colors for the most popular routes (80, etc), and gray for the others.  Alternatively, you could use one color for weekday results, another for weekend, and another for both.

The next two plots are beautiful under "How Does Madison Metro Transit Do, Comparing With Wisconsin State and The U.S.?".  Suggestions:
make the right subplot slightly narrower to give a visual cue that it's a different time scale
on the left, show the same Covid-19 highlight
thousands, millions, and billions make it easier to read off than unites like 100,000.  I would have the plot go from 0 to 1.6 million.
You can have better quantitative conclusions.  For example, you could say "in WI overall, ridership is ___% lower in July than January on average.  In Madison, ridership is ___% lower; we infer that students (and UW-Madison instructors and staff) make up ____% of ridership."  For conclusions on the right, you could say something like "COVID-19 has especially affected Madison ridership; whereas WI and the US have seen ___% and ____% declines respectively, Madison has seen a ____% decline"
"What Are The Time During A Year When More People Ride A Bus?" => not sure what this adds beyond the above plot.  Cut it?

"Does Madison Metro Transit Usually Have a Surplus Or Deficit Every Year?" suggestions:
better to have two subplots with share y-axis: Revenue (Left) and Expenses (Right)
make both stacked for consistency?
don't have underscores in legend names
I think this is about operating expenses; can you mention some numbers for capital expenses in the text?
