## How does Madison Metro Transit Do Comparing With Wisconsin State and The U.S.?

<img src="1019-1.png" width="800">

From the left plot, we observe that Madison Metro Transit has a higher volume 
of ridership (more specific term, unlinked passenger trips) than the average of Wisconsin State as well as that of the U.S. 
This makes sense because Madison is the second largest city in the Wisconsin State. 
Ridership in Madison also fluctuates more than others because school seasons affect the
number of boardings. 

Looking more closely to the recent months, we can see the rise of the ridership 
in Madison has a lot to do with the opening of the school. January 30th, 2020 was the day
when WHO started to inform the world about the outbreak, and March 11th was when we started
to quarantine, which both of them contributed to the decreasing trend. The number of ridership in Madison 
reached a peak of 1,278,838 in February; nonetheless, dropped drastically to a troughs of 
110,054 in April. 

[Note: The ridership data of Madison was last updated in April, so we only have the data available till April 2020]
 
 ## What Are The Time During A Year When More People Ride A Bus?

Notice that the off season (in red) in Madison is during the summer times and in December and January; 
and the peak season (in green) is February, March, September, October, and November. The `Avg` on the 
y-axis is calculated from the mean of all ridership from January 2016 to 2020 April, and on the x-axis is 
the mean of each month.   


## Does Madison Metro Transit Usually Have a Surplus Or Deficit Every Year?

<img src="1019-3.png" width="800">

Significant updates led to the **increasing** trend for revenue in 2013:
1. Route 70 rerouted from Northbook Dr (Middleton) to Parmenter Street.
2. Route 75 added in March 2012, significantly reduces the travel time from the Madison CBD to the Epic campus.
3. Route 85 was deleted and absorbed into Route 80.

Significant event led to the **decreasing** trend for revenue in 2016:
1. Paratransit (community transportation servicec) funding loss due to Family Care expanding into Dane County.

Salaries, Wages, and Benefits are the major expense of Madison Metro Transit, accounting for an average of 73.24% 
of the total revenue of that year (details in the plot below).
