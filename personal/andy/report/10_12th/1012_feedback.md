No worries, 638 is a great opportunity to practice speaking in front of an audience and getting comfortable with that!

I'll rate these a 3.  I'm expecting some accompanying text (full paragraphs) to go with this.  Don't have details hidden that need to be expanded.  Decide what is important for the audience to know, then say that.  For example, naming the four routes that are off during the week is probably interesting.  The other details are a bit much.

Please make the maps smaller.

Take out the table and bullet points.  Write text to explain what is important about the visuals you are showing.
