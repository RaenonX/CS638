## Introduction

In this analysis, we look at `service_id = 92` because the current `trip.csv` (one of the main datasets that have the trips detail) does not take the suspended services into account; 
[The data with `service_id = 93` are the dataset that include the suspended services.]

For the service type, we look at the data that have prefixes 93 (e.g. 93_WKD, 93_WKD:R, 93_SAT, etc.) because data with prefixes 93 are more recent, more specifically, it is recorded from October 4th to November 28th, 2020.
[The data of `service_type` with prefixes 92 are from August 23rd to October 3rd, 2020]

## User Inputs
#### 1. `Service Type:`
- `wkd`: weekday
- `sat`: Saturday
- `sun`: Sunday
- `hol`: holday
- `mwk`: modified week

#### 2. `Time` 
[e.g. `6:30:00` is 6:30 in the morning, `18:50:30` is 6:50 at 30th second in the evening]

#### 3. `Number of points`
[input `Number of points = 200` will return `1000` points (random bus riders) for each zoning districts (for datail see below)]


## Begin
Accoridng to [city of Madison open data](https://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/zoning-districts), The city of Madison is categorized into 5 *zoning districts*, that are, *Residential Districts*, *Commercial and Mixed-Use Districts*, *Employment Districts*, *Downtown and Urban Districts*, and *Special Districts*. Each *zone* is basically an area that has a set of regulations and differs from other zones.

For more details of each *zoning districts*, [see here](https://www.cityofmadison.com/assessor/documents/ZoningDistricts.pdf).

Here is an example from last week, which randomly generates 500 bus riders.

### What are the averages of `distance to the nearest bus stop`, `number of available routes`, and `waiting time for the soonest coming bus` for these randomly generated bus riders based on the zoning districts?

Looking at the first column of the above 3 plots are averages of `distance to the nearest bus stop`. It will not be affected by the time, nor different service types, and therefore the pattern of height of bars of each plot is very similar to one another. 
*Residential districts*, *employment districts*, and *special districts* have the higher averages of travel distance to the nearest bus stop. This makes sense because many individuals that belong to these zoning districts are distributed in a more suburban/countryside areas. *Downtown and Urban Districts* has the lowest as many buses travel from East Madison to West.

The second column of the above 3 plots are the average `number of routes` at each bus stop, reached by random-generated bus riders. 
*Downtown and Urban Districts* has the highest because the shape of downtown Madison is relatively narrow, and it is also one of the major transfer points. In the meantime, other districts have an average of 1 to 2 options to routes that one can take at each bus stop.

The third column is the average `waiting time` a random-generated bus rider has to wait at the corresponding bus stop.
Usually more options/accessibility to routes means less waiting time for the soonest coming bus. There might still be some design bugs to this function since the algorithm of calculating the waiting time is taking only the shortest-distanced bus stop into consideration.

stuck:

different directions
- each can vary greatly (e.g. one direction can go to a transfer point the other don't)
- if considering taking a transfer to another route, -> too complicated

TODO:
1. running simulation to get a less error result

2. measure number of boarding at each stop
