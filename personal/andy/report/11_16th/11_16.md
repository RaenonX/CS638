note:
- we look at service_id = 92 because the current trip.csv excludes suspended
services; service_id = 93 can be later used when we could collect more data.
92 = suspended service excluded; 93 = included
(7 & 20 are special cases (only suspended some trips))

data record time:
- 20200823 - 20201003 for 92, 20201004 - 20201128 for 93
- here we'll pick 93
- service type included: WKD, SAT, SUN, HOL, MWK
