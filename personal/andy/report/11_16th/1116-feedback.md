Thanks, you really did a lot this week!  Have you all decided on a general outline?  That seems to be the first step for fitting in all the results that belong in the final version.

Your questions:
our model will always make some simplifying assumptions.  For example, even if you fix this one, I think it will still assume riders can walk diagonal, cutting through yards/buildings.  Best to make a list of simplifying assumptions, and prioritize which ones to resolve.
I agree, it might be slow to execute, which might be a reason that this is a simplifying assumption that doesn't go away this semester
I'll rate these a 4 -- I really like the presentation style!  Here are some things to improve:
each column of subplots is a different stat.  Can we add a column for area covered, as computed by the simulator?  That's the most interesting metric, in my opinion
make the font bigger
remove redundancy.  If you say "Weekday" in the title above the subplots, you don't need to repeat "on Weekday" for each plot.  Removing this will make it easier for the eye to focus on differences.
Writing:
"Here is an example from last week" => don't write it like a status update, but instead work to produce draft text that might eventually be used in the final version
"we look at the data that have prefixes 93 (e.g. 93_WKD, 93_WKD:R, 93_SAT, etc.)" => best to explain what you're doing at a higher level.  The average reader won't care about the IDs or service names, but will want to know what kind of service the analysis is for
