# Impact on limiting max transfer count

The following performance measurements are based on the following configuration:

- Starting coordinate: `(43.069451, -89.401168)` - Close to Merit Residence Hall of UW-Madison
- Starting time: `2020/09/02 PM 3:00 CDT`
- Walking Speed: `4.2 km/h (2.610 mi)`
- Max. Travel Time: `2700 s (30 mins)`
- Max. Walking Distance: `0.7 km (0.435 mi)`
- Max. Waiting Time: `900 s (15 mins)`
- Non-sense paths are `pruned`
- Detouring paths are `excluded`

## Max transfer # x Path discovery performance

## Max transfer # x Path #

## Max transfer # x Path # distribution

## Max transfer # x Move event distribution

# TODOs

> This is copied from the 11/16 report. Should be modified.

### Prioritized

- ~~Generate the report of impact on different max transfer count.~~ (Should be completed.)

- Allow dummy agents estimation method to be integrated.

  - Count the accessed count of a certain coordinate block.
  
  - Needs to use parallelism for optimization.

- Interpolate population data.

### Normal

- Plot the area/points reached for a single simulation.

- Same stop transfer only

  - Needs to find which stops share the same route and don't require a lot of wait time (for test).
  
  - Currently, all transfers under T travel = 2700 s w/ Max wait time = 900 s needs walk.

- Calculate the travel experience score for a single path.

  - Travel experience score will be determined by bus %, walk %, etc.
