## Stops which do not have ridership data

![](../assets/reports/0921-1.png)

We found that despite these stops exist, they do not have the ridership data. 

Because the ridership data used in this program is collected in Mar 2019, 
we assume that these stops were deployed after the data collection date.

<details><summary>List of stops (69) that do not have ridership data</summary>

These are sorted by stop ID.

## Better conception of the count of stops in the city

### Before (09/14)

![](../assets/reports/0914-1.png)

### After (09/21)

![](../assets/reports/0921-2.png)

Comparing to the previous week (09/14), we grouped the stops located on the same cross, according to MMT GTFS data.

The count of the stops in a region is much more accurate than the previous one, 
because the same stop with different direction is now counter as one (1) instead of two (2).

This still needs to be improved, because some stops that were supposed to be grouped were not grouped.

For example, the stops on E Gorham St. and E Johnson St. were separated, 
because both of these streets are single-way streets.
Using the current algorithm, stops on these streets are being counted as 2 for a single intersection instead of 1 
(Check the image below).

## Finding the stops that can/cannot be removed 

First, we grouped the stops that are basically located around the same road cross as one.

Then, we assume that there are equal number of people with equal density living in Madison. 

If we remove a single stop, then the people living around it may need to travel farther to reach a stop.

We used this scenario to "deploy" the dummy agents around the stops being removed. 
Then, we calculate that if a stop was being removed, what will be the new closest stop distance for these agents.

For measuring the overall impact of this, we created an index which:

- Positive number means that the distance between the agents and their closest stop is shorter.
   - The agents will almost never use the stop being removed.

- Negative number means that the agents will need to travel farther to reach the closest stop.
   - They are likely to use the stop that was being removed.
   
- More punishments on the data cut point shift that shifts toward farther while they are already far from the stop, 
vice versa.
