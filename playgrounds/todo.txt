# TODO:
# 1. try remove one stop and put passenger flows to closest
#     two bus stops that have the same route
# 2. see if the amount of passenger at one stop is too large
# 3. calculate time if remove one stop is quicker
#     - how to determine which stop to remove?
#     - factors influencing time travel or

# 1. find overlap routes > some threshold
# 2. find their common bus stops and determine if
#    they can be integrated by calculating their sum
#    of passenger flow
# 3. see if removing a bus stop works and improve the
#    time traveling of that combined bus route
#       - removing a bus stop when adjacent bus stop
#         is close to each other


# fix the plot resolution and sizes (markersize and so on)
